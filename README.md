# Matrix Multiplication Performance Analysis

_Individual Assignment â€” Big Data (Task 1, 2025)_

This repository contains the project for the "Individual Assignment: Task 1 for Big Data". The project implements a standard matrix multiplication algorithm in **C, Java, and Python** to compare their performance.

The analysis includes:
* Parameterized code for matrix size and number of repetitions.
* Separation of production logic, benchmarking code, and unit tests.
* A final report in PDF format detailing the methodology, results, and conclusions.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

* `src/`: Contains the core implementation of the matrix multiplication algorithm for each language (`c`, `java`, `python`).
* `tests/`: Includes unit tests to verify the correctness of each implementation.
* `output-data/`: Stores the raw performance results (`.csv` files) generated by the benchmarks.
* `paper/`: Contains the final PDF report (`Report_Matrix.pdf`) and the performance graph (`performance_plot.png`).
* `plot_results.py`: A Python script used to generate the performance graph from the `.csv` data.

## How to Run the Benchmarks

To replicate the experiments, you can run the benchmarking scripts from the root directory. All scripts accept `--size` and `--repeats` arguments.

### C
```bash
# First, compile the code
gcc -O2 -o src/c/run_c src/c/cli.c src/c/matmul.c

# Then, run the benchmark
./src/c/run_c --size 512 --repeats 3
```

### Java
```bash
# First, compile the code
javac src/java/MatrixOps.java src/java/MatrixCLI.java

# Then, run the benchmark (specifying the classpath)
java -cp src/java MatrixCLI --size 512 --repeats 3
```

### Python
```bash
# Run the script (requires pandas and matplotlib for plotting)
python src/python/cli.py --size 512 --repeats 3
```

## Final Report

The complete analysis, methodology, and discussion of the results can be found in the final report: **[Full PDF Report](./paper/Report_Matrix.pdf)**
